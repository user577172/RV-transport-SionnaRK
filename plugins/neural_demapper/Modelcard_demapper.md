# Training and Evaluation Datasets:
 
## Training Dataset:
 
**Data Collection Method by dataset**
Synthetic
 
**Labeling Method by dataset**
Synthetic
**Properties:** Synthetic QAM symbols generated from a predefined set of possible values, with additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) applied dynamically during training to simulate real-world wireless channel conditions. Each sample represents a noisy transmission of a QAM-modulated signal, where the AWGN models the stochastic effects of the wireless environment. This process ensures that the demapper is trained on a diverse range of signal variations, improving robustness to real-world impairments in modern communication systems.
