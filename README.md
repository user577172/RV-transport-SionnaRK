# Sionna Research Kit: A GPU-Accelerated Research Platform for AI-native RAN

The [Sionna Research Kit](https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna-rk) is an accelerated, open platform for wireless research and development. Powered by the [NVIDIA DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) and built on [OpenAirInterface](https://openairinterface.org), it provides a software-defined 5G RAN and core network for end-to-end experimentation running in real-time.

Created by the team behind [Sionna](https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna), it features textbook-quality tutorials and [O-RAN](https://www.o-ran.org/)-compliant interfaces. In just one afternoon, you will connect commercial 5G equipment to a network using your own customizable transceiver algorithms. Conducting [AI-RAN](https://ai-ran.org/) experiments, whether simulated, cabled, or over-the-air, has never been more accessible.

The official documentation can be found [here](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/rk).
You can build the documentation locally via ```make doc```. This may require manually installing `sudo apt install pandoc` and `pip install -r requirements_doc.txt`.

See the [Quickstart Guide](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/rk/quickstart.html) to get started.
